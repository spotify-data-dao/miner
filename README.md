We believe in an open internet where users own their data and the AI models they contribute to. OpenAI takes your data and uses it to create pay-for-access models.

We serve a GPT that runs locally on your device. Instead of paying to use the model (ala OpenAI), you earn for using the GPT and contributing to the network.
